Specific Questions for Feedback: 

Hi, Dr. Byrd! 

I hope that you are doing well. For this draft, I feel as though I have written about all of my main points, but I don't know if I have brought them all together well enough. 
My first, and most important, question is about that. Do you think that I am tying it together into one cohesive piece? Or do they all feel disconnected still? 

I feel as though I might have gotten a little off topic as I went along, so if it feels like I'm detracting from my overall purpose, that would be good to know as well. 

My code needs to be cleaned up quite a bit, so I promise that it will look better for the next draft. However, I did still put in the Canva cover photo and one of the Knight Lab tools to test it. If they do not work, or you cannot see it, that would also be really helpful to know. 

Any other feedback about how I can start to move this toward a document to use as my writing sample would also be very helpful! I feel like I need to go deeper on my analysis to get it there, and any other input that you have would be wonderful. 

Thanks so much!
